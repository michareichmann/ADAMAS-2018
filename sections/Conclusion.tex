		\begin{itemize}
			\itemfill
			\item built beam test setup to characterise the rate behaviour of diamond pad detectors
			\item most leakage currents \SI{<10}{\nano\ampere} and beam induced currents linear with flux
			\item pCVD diamond show non-uniformity according to wide landau of the signal depending on the position in the diamond
			\item nonirradiated scCVD show no rate dependence (large in irradiated)
			\item rate dependence for most non-irradiated pCVD \SI{<5}{\%}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item unknown origin, maybe surface contamination during production
				\item possible to fix it for one sample \ra try to repeat it\vspace*{5pt}
			\end{itemize}
			\item detectors with irradiated pCVD diamond sensors have a rate dependence below \SI{\sim2}{\%} up to a flux of \SI{20}{\mega\hertz\per \centi\meter^2}
